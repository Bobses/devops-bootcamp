## Jenkins
Jenkins is a tool is mostly used for creating and running complex pipelines which speed up the development process from testing the code to publishing a release package to production environments. In this chapter we'll be setting up our on-premise Jenkins server and work out how to combine GitLab and Jenkins to create a Contiuous Deployment flow.
